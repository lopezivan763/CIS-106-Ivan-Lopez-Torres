# CIS-106-Ivan-Lopez-Torres
##Assignment 1
My name is Ivan Lopez and I'm pursuing a software engineer degree. I always found coding fascinating and challenging. This is why I decided to pursue a career in this field. After changing my degree a few times I can say that I found the right field for me. The harder the challenge is, the more effort and excitement I put into it. I tried to learn coding on my own a few times and it can be pretty difficult at times, but I know that after this course, I will be ready to step it up to the next level.
##Assignment 2
I selected Python as my programming language because I have experienced it and play with this language from time to time. I believe Python is the easiest programming language there is. If I learn how to use Python as my first programming language,  it will be easier for me to merge into a different programming language. I'd like to eventually learn C++ and HTML. I tested OnlineGDB since it was recommended for this assignment, but I might look into Visual studio since it is free. It was also recommended by friends who are also into learning programming languages.
