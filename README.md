# CIS-106-Ivan-Lopez-Torres
##Assignment 1
My name is Ivan Lopez and I'm pursuing a software engineer degree. I always found coding fascinating and challenging. This is why I decided to pursue a career in this field. After changing my degree a few times I can say that I found the right field for me. The harder the challenge is, the more effort and excitement I put into it. I tried to learn coding on my own a few times and it can be pretty difficult at times, but I know that after this course, I will be ready to step it up to the next level.
